This list is heavily skewed toward the **transition zones**—where memory meets emotion (Hippocampus-Amygdala interface)—and the **Social Decision-Making Network** (SDMN).

Unlike the Hypothalamus list, which was about "Drive and State" (Hunger/Aggression), this Amygdala list is about **"Recognition and Interpretation."** It suggests the WildR mice are processing *who* they are interacting with and *how they feel* about them differently.

Here is the breakdown of the specific cell types and the story they tell.

---

### 1. The Social Memory Output (The "Who Are You?" Hub)
*   **Cell Types:** `0069 CA1-ProS Glut_1` (Huge N=102), `016 CA1-ProS Glut`, `0077 CA3 Glut_3`
*   **Full Name:** CA1-Prosubiculum (ProS) and CA3 Pyramidal Neurons.
*   **Function:**
    *   **CA3:** The pattern completion engine. It is critical for "one-shot learning"—rapidly forming a memory of a new individual.
    *   **Prosubiculum (ProS):** This is the **output gate** of the hippocampus specifically projecting to the Amygdala (BLA/MEA) and Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BST). It translates "Memory" into "Emotional Response."
*   **Social Implication:**
    *   **Enhanced Social Recognition:** Social interaction relies on knowing if a mouse is a stranger (threat) or a cage-mate (safe). The massive enrichment of these cells suggests WildR mice have a hyper-active or plastic social memory circuit.
    *   **Reduced Neophobia:** If the ProS-to-Amygdala pathway is altered, the "fear of the new" signal is likely dampened. The WildR mouse recognizes the social context faster and reacts with curiosity rather than caution.

### 2. The Pheromone-to-Action Bridge (The "Fight or Flirt" Switch)
*   **Cell Types:** `0346 MEA-BST Sox6 Gaba_10`, `0349 MEA-BST Lhx6 Sp9 Gaba_3`, `0515 COAa-PAA-MEA Barhl2 Glut_7`
*   **Full Name:** Medial Amygdala (MEA) and Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BST).
*   **Function:**
    *   **The Hub:** The MEA and BST are the core of the **Social Decision-Making Network (SDMN)**.
    *   **Input:** The MEA receives direct input from the Vomeronasal Organ (detecting pheromones/urine).
    *   **Output:** It processes this chemical signal and tells the BST to execute a behavior: **Aggression, Mating, or Parenting.**
*   **Social Implication:**
    *   **Valence Flipping:** In standard laboratory mice (SPF), the smell of another male often triggers the "Defense/Aggression" pathway in the MEA-BST.
    *   **The WildR Shift:** An alteration here suggests that the WildR microbiome has re-tuned this circuit to interpret male pheromones not as a call to war, but as a neutral or affiliative signal. The `Sox6` and `Lhx6` markers indicate inhibitory (GABAergic) control, suggesting a stronger "brake" on the aggression response to scents.

### 3. The Olfactory-Limbic Interface (The "Scent of Emotion")
*   **Cell Types:** `015 ENTmv-PA-COAp Glut`, `0194 RHP-COA Ndnf Gaba_2`
*   **Full Name:** Entorhinal Cortex (ENT), Posterior Amygdala (PA), and Cortical Amygdala (COA).
*   **Function:**
    *   **COA (Cortical Amygdala):** This is the "nose" of the amygdala. It mediates **innate odor-driven behaviors** (e.g., fear of predator urine, attraction to food).
    *   **ENT/RHP:** These regions connect the olfactory system to the hippocampus. They provide the "emotional coloring" to a smell.
*   **Social Implication:**
    *   **Sterile Inflammation Hypothesis:** In SPF mice, these regions might be in a state of low-grade inflammation (neuroimmune activation), making social smells "irritating" or aversive.
    *   **The WildR Shift:** The alteration here implies that the *emotional valence* of smell is different. For a WildR mouse, the scent of a conspecific might trigger reward (via ENT-Hippocampus loops) rather than avoidance.

### 4. The Consciousness & Salience Hub (The "Attention" Network)
*   **Cell Types:** `0001 CLA-EPd-CTX Car3 Glut_1`, `001 CLA-EPd-CTX Car3 Glut`
*   **Full Name:** Claustrum (CLA) and Endopiriform Nucleus (EPd) expressing *Car3* (Carbonic Anhydrase 3).
*   **Function:**
    *   **The Conductor:** The Claustrum is connected to almost the entire cortex. It is thought to be the "seat of consciousness" or, more specifically, **Salience Detection**. It decides *what is important right now*.
    *   **Car3 Neurons:** These are a highly specific population of claustrum neurons that project to cortical areas involved in visceral sensation and stress.
*   **Social Implication:**
    *   **Social Salience:** Why does the WildR mouse interact more? Because it finds the other mouse **more interesting**.
    *   A change in the Claustrum suggests that the *attention* of the mouse is being directed toward social stimuli. The social partner has become a "high salience" object worth exploring.

### 5. The "Intruders" (Hindbrain Confirmation)
*   **Cell Types:** `PGRN-PARN-MDRN Hoxb5 Glut`, `MY Glut`
*   **Analysis:** As noted in the Hypothalamus analysis, these are hindbrain (medulla) cells. Their presence here (likely due to dissection borders or shared transcriptional profiles) reinforces the finding that **Autonomic Tone** (breathing/heart rate) is universally altered in WildR mice, facilitating the calm physiological state required for socialization.

### The Synthesized Story: "Memory, Meaning, and Mood"

While the Hypothalamus story was about "controlling the impulse," the Amygdala story is about **interpreting the signal**.

1.  **Better Recognition (CA1-ProS/CA3):** The WildR mouse has a sharper social memory. It rapidly categorizes the other mouse, reducing the "stranger danger" response.
2.  **Re-interpreted Scent (MEA/COA):** The pheromones of the other mouse are processed through the MEA-BST circuit differently. Instead of triggering the "Aggression" subroutine, they trigger the "Investigate" or "Tolerate" subroutine.
3.  **Higher Engagement (Claustrum):** The mouse pays more attention to social cues because the Claustrum has deemed them salient.

**Conclusion:** The WildR microbiome has remodeled the **Social Decision-Making Network (SDMN)** to favor **recognition and curiosity** over **defensiveness and fear.**
